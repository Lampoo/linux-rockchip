* Rockchip MPP SERVICE

Rockchip MPP (SERVICE) is the service module present kernel which
maintain a workqueue for different mpp device to queue the work.

Because some multimedia devices in Rockchip SoCs share the resources, such
as RK312x, vpu and rkvdec share the registers and inner ram, and these devices
cannot running in the same time, therefor, a service maintain unit queue is
required.

Required properties:
  - compatible : value should be either one among the following
	(a) "rockchip,mpp_service" for a common version present in Rockchip SoCs

Optional properties:

  - reg : Physical base address of the combo IP registers and length of memory
	  mapped region.

Example:
SoC specific DT entry:

rkvenc_srv: rkvenc_srv {
	compatible = "rockchip,mpp_service";
};
